# Lejin Varghese

I have 11 years of experience leading projects across the spectrum of `data science`, `data engineering`, `technology product development` and `systems integrations`. 

I have developed an expertise in creating personalized consumer experiences using recommender systems in the retail, search, e-commerce and marketing domains, and have designed and built these systems for industry leading brands in the automotive, consumer electronics, retail, and consumer packaged goods industries across North America. 

Most of these solutions leveraged algorithms spanning classical statistics, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing and developed/deployed on cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP and Azure.

I am a continuous learner, a data hog, a scientist, an engineer hybrid and an aspiring polymath who's most lately passionate about graph neural networks, recommender systems, optimization algorithms, complexity theory, reinforcement learning and adaptive intelligent systems. I value integrity, innovation and humancentric progress.
